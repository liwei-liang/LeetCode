/*Approach #1 Using Recursion [Accepted]
We can traverse both the given trees in a preorder fashion. At every step, we check if the current node exists(isn't null) for both the trees. If so, we add the values in the current nodes of both the trees and update the value in the current node of the first tree to reflect this sum obtained. At every step, we also call the original function mergeTrees() with the left children and then with the right children of the current nodes of the two trees. If at any step, one of these children happens to be null, we return the child of the other tree(representing the corresponding child subtree) to be added as a child subtree to the calling parent node in the first tree. At the end, the first tree will represent the required resultant merged binary tree.

The following animation illustrates the process.*/
class TreeNode {
	int val;
	TreeNode left;
	TreeNode right;

	TreeNode(int x) {
		val = x;
	}
}

public class MergeTwoBinaryTrees {
	public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
		if (t1 == null) {
			return t2;
		}
		if (t2 == null) {
			return t1;
		}
		t1.val += t2.val;
		t1.left = mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
		t1.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
		return t1;
	}
}
